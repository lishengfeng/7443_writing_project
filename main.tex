Virtual machine was defined as an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real computer machine. It dates to the 1960s and still widely be used in operating system. While Docker 
is a computer program that also provide an environment that can run other applications on top of the kernel in an isolated way and is still a very young program with only five years age. Many people might think that docker is some sort of lightweight or trimmed down virtual machine but it's actually not. Though virtual machine and docker both run on the top of any operating system, they have very different architectures.

\section{Introduction}
This paper tries to illustrate the architecture of virtual machine and the docker. And by comparing the difference between them, it helps us obtain a better perspective about which technology fits your scenario better. Virtual machine technology has been developing for more than 50 years. It is universally known and is still widely used. Docker, on the other way, is very new comparing to virtual machine and is becoming more and more popular these days as it can avoid the overhead of resource utilization.

A virtual machine emulates a physical computing environment, but requests for CPU, memory, hard disk, network and other hardware resources. Those requests are managed by a virtualization layer which translates these requests to the underlying physical hardware. Virtual machines are powered by hypervisors which is a software that can provides isolation for virtual machines running on top of physical host. In other word, you can several virtual machines running simultaneously on a infrastructure without interfering with each other. Many cloud infrastructure provides such virtualization such as Google Computer Engine, Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2. However, since all the virtual machines need to require their own hardware resource, resource overhead is involved. 

Docker is an modern open source platform. The goal of docker is to make development, shipment and deployment easier for developers. When Docker emerged in 2013, container exploded in popularity. Docker is a very new software. However, the technology docker originally used was LinuX Containers(LXC)\footnote{LXC is the well known set of tools, templates, library and language bindings. It's pretty low level, very flexible and covers just about every containment feature supported by the upstream kernel.}. LXC was the first, most complete implementation of Linux container manager and it was implemented in 2008. LXC can run on a single Linux kernel without requiring any patches. And in the later years docker replaced LXC container manager with its own library, libcontainer(runC)\footnote{runC is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification}. Container is an image generated by the docker which has all the supporting dependencies packaged into a standard form. Containers also run on top of the kernel but share the hardware resource with the kernel. This architecture makes container much lighter than the virtual machine, hence extremely improve the performance. And the containers keep running in an isolated way as well.

This paper is a review on technology of virtual machine and docker, and will compare the performance between those two technology. The article is organized as follow. The first section will introduce the technology of virtual machine. The second section will introduce the technology of docker. The third section will focus on the comparison between docker and virtual machine. 

\section{Virtual Machine}
Virtual machine begins with some type of infrastructure which could be you laptop, a dedicated server running in a data center or a virtual private server that you're using in the cloud such as digital ocean, Google Computer Engine, Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2 etc. On top of the infrastructure runs an operating system that could be Mac OS, Windows or some distribution of Linux. When we talking about VMs(Virtual machines), the operating system is commonly labeled as the host. Above the host operating system, we have a thing called hypervisor. Hypervisor is a software which provides isolation for virtual machines running on top of host operating system. We can think of virtual machine as a self-contained computer packed into a single file but something needs to be able to run that file. That's where a hypervisor comes into play. There are two types of hypervisors. The first type of hypervisors directly link to the infrastructure such as HyperKit(OSX), Hyper-V(Win) and KVM(Linux). Another one runs an application on the host operating system such as VirtualBox and VMWare. Usually hypervisors belong to the first type are more efficient because they can bypass the host operating system and directly interact with the hardware of the server. The next layer above the hypervisor is the guest operating systems\footnote{VM is called as the guest while the environment it runs on is called the host}. We can run as many guest OS as possible as long as the infrastructure can afford the hardware resource requirement in total isolation. Those guest operating systems are all controlled by the hypervisor and are not required to be the same. We could run Windows, Mac OS, distribution Linux and other supported OS.  On top of the OS, there are applications and libraries. The Figure \ref{fig:vma} shows the architecture of the virtual machine. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\psfig{file=VM_architecture.eps, height=2in, width=2in,}
\caption{Virtual Machine Architecture}
\label{fig:vma}
\vskip -6pt
\end{figure}

\subsection{Disadvantage of Virtual Machine}
Each guest OS requires its own requirement of hardware resources. Assume each guest OS require 1GB disk space, then the total disk space required would be 1GB $\times$ 3. Not to mention other requirements such as CPU, memory and network. Whenever an instance starts within the virtual environment, all the resources that have been assigned to it start being used. So if you assign four gigabytes of RAM to a virtual server as soon as that virtual server has started, four gigabytes of RAM from the hardware will automatically be assigned to that virtual server. If you have three server that boot up with four gigabytes of RAM, 4GB $\times$ 3 will be allocated to those servers whether or not they actually need it. Each one of those servers may only need one gigabyte RAM currently and other idle RAM can't be given somewhere else. Every single instance of an operating system has to have these over-allocated resources allocated to it and  This results in a lot of resources waste. Another issue is that the virtual machine emulating an entire server which means you have to run the whole boot up process. Suppose you create a virtual server that only does DNS, when you do some configuration, you have to reboot the entire computer and going through the whole boot process which takes a lot of time. 

\section{Docker Containers}
At the beginning, the docker containers also need the infrastructure. The second level is the host operating system. Then we have a layer called docker daemon. Docker daemon is a service that runs in the background on our host OS and manages everything required to run and interact with docker containers. After that, we have binaries and libraries just like the virtual machines but instead of being ran on a guest OS, they get built into special packages called docker images. The docker daemon runs those images. The applications would end up residing in its own docker image and will be managed independently by the docker daemon. Typically, each application and its library dependencies get packed into the same docker image. Each application is still isolated. In docker scenario, we don't need to run any type of hypervisor or virtual machine. Instead the docker daemon communicates directly with the host operating system and knows how to ration the resources for the running docker containers. It's also an expert and ensuring each container is isolated from both the host OS and other containers. There is also no virtualization needed with docker since it runs directly on the host OS. The Figure \ref{fig:da} shows the architecture of the docker.

\centering
\psfig{file=docker_architecture.eps, height=2in, width=2in,}
\caption{Docker Architecture}
\label{fig:da}
\vskip -6pt
\end{figure}

\subsection{Advantage of Docker(LXC)}
LXC, also known as Linux container, is created for the services the virtual servers will provide. The underlying hardware resources and kernel is shared from all the containers. You can have one container that is equivalent of a LAMP\footnote{LAMP is an open source Web development platform that uses Linux as the operating system, Apache as the Web server, MySQL as the rational database management system and PHP/Perl/Python as the object-oriented scripting language.} server which has all the required software installed, the configuration files and IP address etc. But the container doesn't have the kernel and the RAM directly associated with it. The kernel and the RAM and some other resources and on the lower level. You can also have a DNS or a DHCP or a file server container at the same time besides the LAMP container. Those containers share the underlying RAM, hard drive, CPU and the kernel. RAM still be controlled by the single host kernel who is expert. It's like running services on any kind of server. You don't need to worry about RAM or hard drive allocation. Furthermore, When one of the server needs to be restart, you don't need to have the boot process like the virtual machine has. Also the containers are completely segregated. They have their own IP addresses. They interact with the rest of the network such as the host and other containers just like they are individual servers but using the same kernel. 

\subsection{Disadvantage of Docker Container}
Even though there are some improvement of container comparing to virtual machine, there are some drawbacks of container too. 
\begin{itemize}
\item As containers share the kernel with the host, you cannot have a windows container running on a linux kernel.
\item Since containers need to be the same with host kernel, you cannot have multiple different containers running at the same time. 
\item The container is more like a service, it does not provide you the complete virtualization.
\item Docker is till young. It requires some new built-in features to support container such as LXC or runC. Many ole machines will not able to use docker.
\item Thought docker supports cross-platform, the containers might not work the same in different systems and even different distributions. In linux, the kernels in different distribution, such as Ubuntu, Fedora and CentOS etc, are not consistent.
\item Security issues need to be evaluated. The kernel is shared among containers. Containers could be malicious. 
\end{itemize}

\end{table*}

\subsection{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed or supported.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=fly.eps, height=1in, width=1in}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that has been resized with the \texttt{epsfig} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\epsfig{file=flies.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\psfig{file=rosette.eps, height=1in, width=1in,}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.ps format) that has
been resized with the \texttt{psfig} command.}
\vskip -6pt
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
